# Drop Tower Simulation

The drop tower is an attraction often found in amusement parks. Riders enter a gondola at ground level, the gondola rides up a vertical tower, then drops down. The brakes come on to stop the gondola as it approaches the bottom of the course. That way you experience free fall, followed by a sharp deceleration. One of the types of brakes used in these towers are magnetic, and they work based on eddy currents. With the help of the MATLAB language, we were able to simulate the behavior of these rides.
